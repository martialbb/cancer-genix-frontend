## ðŸ”Œ Backend Connection

This frontend is designed to work with the [cancer-genix-backend](https://github.com/martialbb/cancer-genix-backend) repository. To connect to the backend:

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. Set `PUBLIC_API_URL` to point to your backend URL (default: http://localhost:8000)

For local development, both repositories should be cloned separately:

```sh
# Clone frontend (this repo)
git clone https://github.com/martialbb/cancer-genix-frontend.git

# Clone backend repo (in a separate directory)
git clone https://github.com/martialbb/cancer-genix-backend.git
```
